## Description

_This application is a demonstration of creating and using basic functions to create a very basic calculator and learning about the separation of the user-interface logic("front-end") and the business logic("backend") and basic regular expressions_.

_I created a browser-based GUI for a very basic calculator that uses CSS3 properties such as border-radius, transform, and box-shadow to make a more modern feel to the UI. Also, a sprinkle of regular expressions is used to substitute the 'x' sign for multiplication and the 'รท' sign for division when computing the values using JavaScript functions_.
