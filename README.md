## Description

_This app is a demonstration of creating and using basic functions to create an evolving calculator_.<br/>
_That's why I called it **Fluffy Calculator**_.<br/>
_It explains the separation of the user-interface logic("front-end") and the business logic("back-end")_.<br/>

_The business logic and user interface logic are distinctly separate sections of the (scripts.js file)_.<br/>
_The user interface sections is responsible for gathering user-given values, parsing them into integers_,<br/>
_and calling our add() function when the user submits a form. It also displays the result of the add()_<br/> _function directly on the page. Essentially, it's handling all interactivity with the user_.<br/>
_It can call a back-end function (as seen in var result = _add(number1, number2);), but the function_<br/>
_is not defined here in this block of code. That's the responsibility of the business, or back-end-logic_.<br/>

_The business logic contains functions for all capabilities that this calculator will eventually have_.<br/>
_It instructs the application what to do when a user opts to add two numbers, or when a user wants to_<br/> _divide two numbers (a feature I will add later on). All logic here occurs behind the scenes_.<br/>
_The user interface logic may call one of the business logic's functions when necessary, but the these_<br/> _functions themselves are defined in the back-end_.
